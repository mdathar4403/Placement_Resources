# Placement and Internship Resources 📚💼

Welcome to this curated repository of resources for internships and placements. Whether you're just getting started or looking for advanced preparation material, this repo is here to guide and support you.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi! I'm Md Athar, a final-year student at **IIT (BHU) Varanasi**, pursuing my Electronic Engineering. Over the past few years, I've explored and learned a lot through both academics and real-world experiences.

- 👨‍🏫 I completed my **summer internship** at **Coforge** where I worked on an AI/NLP-based complaint management system.
- 🏦 I received a **full-time role as a Software Engineer at Deutsche Bank**.
- 💡 I have also worked on various projects in **web development, data science**, and **cloud computing**.
- 🏆 I've been fortunate to win several coding and tech competitions during college.

## 📦 What’s Inside?

This repo contains a bunch of useful materials:
- 📑 PDFs and notes on DSA, OS, DBMS, CN, System Design
- 📘 Aptitude and reasoning practice material
- 💻 Resume tips and formats
- 🔗 Useful links for mock interviews, roadmaps, and tutorials
- 📚 Books and eBooks for placement prep
- ⏳ I will update this repo regularly to add more materail for your prep.

## 💬 Why I Made This

I’ve seen the pressure and confusion juniors often face while preparing for internships and placements. I was lucky to have some mentors guide me, and now I want to do the same for you all.

This repo is a small attempt to **pay it forward**.
